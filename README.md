## Overview

- A simple project that changes the background color when you press the button.
- This project is just for practice.

## My process

- made the HTML then the CSS which were the simplist part.

- attempted to do the Javascript portion without looking up the solution at first. Spent an hour on the Javascript without the project functioning

- Looked up other solutions for the project and compared that to my own code.

- broke down the code to steps so I could understand how the code works

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

- What I learned is to focus on completing projects rather than trying to get it to be perfect. I think as a beginner I need to acceot there will be lots of mistakes

- I learned how to make a randomizer work with an array and how to work with the eventListener

- learned how to customize a button

### Continued development

- I plan on improving my CSS skilss. Making the button for this project has shown me what a little CSS can do to improve the look of a project.

- I will continue to do more projects to get a better understanding of javascript

### Useful resources

- [flatuicolors.com](https://flatuicolors.com/) - Used this site to get the colors for the randomizer

- [learn-webdev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jznWWxPZkvQ&t=14s) - This video was really helpful. At first I tried to use a loop to cycle through the colors which didn't work. My code is really just a copy of theirs. But I did take the time to understand the code rather than just copying and pasting it. My goal is to learn how to code and blindly copying code is going to get me there.
